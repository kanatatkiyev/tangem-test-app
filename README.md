# Test app for Tangem 

Link: https://tangem-test-app.netlify.app/

Description:

- Tech stack (React, TypeScript, Vite, Styled components)
- App has 2 banners, but there is no scenario of closing top banner in docs and I made it so by closing top banner -> bottom banner will appear. Base functionality with dissapearing top banner from viewport and appearing bottom banner also made. 


For designer:

- There is no any clear typography system
- No color palette
- No button states like hover, focus
- Gift image was added uncomfortable. It seems unable to import it properly

Time: 2.5 hrs. Most time spent on architecture (scalability), configuration and image import))))
